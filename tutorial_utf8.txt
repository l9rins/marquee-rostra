GShsModel1
 
(Model
 
-
 
Part

Defines
 
shoe
 
model,
 
assigned
 
to
 
the
 
player.
 
Each
 
model
 
is
 
stored
 
in
 
2
  
separate
 
files
 
(they
 
can
 
be
 
located
 
in
 
the
 
main
 
game
 
folder
 
or
 
in
 
the
 
"shoes"
 
folder,
 
which
 
neighbours
 
the
 
"Saves"
 
folder
 
of
  
the
 
game)
 
and
 
has
 
a
 
unique
 
32-digit
 
hex-
 
code,
 
identifying
 
it.
 
These
 
codes
 
are
 
contained
 
in
 
shoe
 
file
 
names
 
(the
 
main
  
file
 
of
 
each
 
shoe
 
model
 
has
 
a
 
code,
 
which
 
is
 
less
 
by
 
1,
 
than
 
the
 
secondary
 
file's
 
one).
 
To
 
assign
 
a
 
shoes
 
model,
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
get
 
the
 
code,
 
contained
 
in
 
the
 
main
 
file's
 
name,
 
and
 
input
 
it
 
consecutively
 
digit-by-digit
 
into
 
this
 
and
 
the
 
3
 
next
  
fields,
 
so
 
each
 
field
 
contains
 
exactly
 
8
 
digits.
 
NOTE:
 
the
 
shoe
 
brand
 
MUST
 
be
 
appropriate
 
to
 
the
 
model
 
to
 
get
 
a
 
positive
 
result.
